-- Test that we use the ghc_config rule's "default_options" attr
-- when compiling Haskell code.
-- This test in particular checks that we've enabled ScopedTypeVariables,
-- which is currently a default option.
-- If we remove ScopedTypeVariables as a default option, this test may start
-- failing, in which case we should check for a different flag.
module Main where

main = myId $ return ()

-- NOTE: this tests that we use the config default_options field.
-- Specifically, it checks that we enable ScopedTypeVariables.  Without that
-- option, we'd get an error like "Illegal symbol '.' in type".
-- If that behavior ever changes, this test will need to be updated.
